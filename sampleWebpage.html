    <h1>Snoop Dogg</h1>
    <p><i>Snoop Dogg</i> was recently part of a long-overdue Superbowl performance by some of the most famous hip-hop artists of all time.</p>
    <h2>Dr. Dre</h2>
    <p><strong>Dr. Dre, the famous producer </strong> who was once part of the kings of gangsta rap, N.W.A., and also worked with Snoop early on in both their careers, was also part of the performance.</p>
    <h3>Eminem</h3>
    <p>The Real Slim Shady, arguably the <b>greatest rapper of all time</b>, also made an appearance, and took a knee as a statement to bring attention to how poorly black lives in America are metaphorical dumped on daily. Coincidentally enough, Eminem taking a knee didn't anger white America, yet Colin Kaepernick is still slandered on <sub>Fox Entertainment News on a weekly basis.</sub> <sup>Amazing.</sup> </p>
